The Statsig SDK for React Native with Expo. If you're looking to use Statsig for React Native without Expo, try [https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native](https://github.com/statsig-io/react-native). If you need a SDK for another language or server environment, check out our [other SDKs](https://docs.statsig.com/#sdks?ref=gh_rne).

Statsig helps you move faster with Feature Gates (Feature Flags) and Dynamic Configs. It also allows you to run A/B tests to validate your new features and understand their impact on your KPIs. If you're new to Statsig, create an account at [statsig.com](https://www.statsig.com?ref=gh_rne).
